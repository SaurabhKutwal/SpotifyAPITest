# Spotify API Testing Framework


## Overview

This project is a comprehensive API testing framework for the Spotify API, developed using Cucumber and TestNG. It is designed to validate the functionality of various Spotify services, including User Service, Artist Service, and Playlist Service. The framework follows modern design principles like the Service Object Model and integrates various tools and libraries for efficient testing and reporting.

## Features
